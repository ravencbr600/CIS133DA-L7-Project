# Lesson 7 Project
The client from your previous lesson was impressed by your work and has hired you again. Within the next few weeks, they will be working with you closely to create web pages that will connect within a website for their computer company.

The page you create in this lesson will be used as a template for the client, therefore the information on the web page can be sparse but the structure must be complete and in working order before you turn it in.

## Project Prep
1. If you haven't done so already, clone the repo to your computer within your course folder.
2. Open the repo within VS Code. You can open this `readme.md` file within VS Code to view the project directions there. 

   > **TIP:** Right click on the file and choose the `Open Preview` option.
3. If there are files and folders present other than this `readme.md` file, take some time to familiarize yourself with the files within the repo so you know where they are located. This will help you when asked to use them within the project directions.

   > **TIP:** Before beginning any work on the project, read through all the steps to understand what you will be doing.

1. Using the Explorer Pane in VS Code, create a subfolder to your Lesson 7 course folded called: **images**.

    > **TIP:** See [How To: Create a Subfolder in VS Code](https://riosalado.coursearc.com/index.php?cID=14714#vssubfolder) if you need help creating a subfolder.
0. Move the image file included in the repo to your **images** subfolder.
